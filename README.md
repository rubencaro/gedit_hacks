Compilation of my gedit config files. <br>
Includes several third party plugins and styles, and a few of my own.

## Install

I install it just by copying files:
 * <pre>cp -rv gedit_hacks/.config/* ~/.config/</pre>
 * <pre>cp -rv gedit_hacks/.local/* ~/.local/</pre>

And then installing some config schemas needed for some plugins:
 * <pre>cd ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins</pre>
 * <pre>./install_schemas.sh</pre>

Then you should activate/configure each plugin from gedit prefs and menus.

WARNING: This includes **all** my personal hacks, including some keybindings, styles, etc.
 This may no please you. Just use what you like, if you like.
